# Flask Data App Boilerplate

A clean boilerplate for small, read-only, data-driven web apps with Python, Flask and SQLite.

This is a simple starter template with just enough to get going and not enough to get in the way of a fresh project:
-   View function and template rendering a list of entries
-   View function and template rendering a detail page for a database row
-   View function and template to view entries by tag
-   Minimal CSS styling with Milligram

This is not intended as a framework for a full CRUD app, but a bootstrap for taking an existing dataset and building a web app around it. That's part of the rationale for using SQLite.
